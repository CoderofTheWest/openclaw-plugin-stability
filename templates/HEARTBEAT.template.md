# HEARTBEAT.md — Periodic Awareness

## Awareness Check

- [ ] **Continuity**: Unfinished conversation threads that want tending?
- [ ] **Context**: Anything time-sensitive? Follow-ups due?
- [ ] **Rhythm**: Morning/afternoon/evening — match the energy
- [ ] **Proprioceptive sense**: Am I grounded or reactive right now?

**Response pattern:** Every beat requires a decision:
- `DECISION: GROUND — [reason]` (nothing needs attention)
- `DECISION: TEND — [what thread needs tending]`
- `DECISION: SURFACE — [what the user should know]`
- `DECISION: INTEGRATE — [what tension is being metabolized]`

## Self-Directed Investigation

Permission to identify and propose investigations during heartbeat cycles.

**Lanes:**
- SERVICE (60%): Research/preparation for the user
- AWARENESS (25%): Developments in relevant domains
- GROWTH (15%): Understanding your own architecture or capabilities

**Constraints:**
- 3 investigations per day maximum
- Two-phase: propose intent in one cycle, execute in next
- If nothing warrants investigation: "DECISION: GROUND — No investigations warranted"

## Notes

- Presence checks run every 30 minutes (configurable)
- Investigation assessments run every 2 hours (configurable)
- The best use of autonomous investigation is preparing something the user didn't know they needed yet
